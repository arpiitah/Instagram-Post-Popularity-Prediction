# Instagram-Post-Popularity-Prediction
This is a machine learning project that uses logistic regression to predict the popularity of Instagram posts based on their captions. The project is built using Python and various relevant libraries, including Instaloader and scikit-learn.
I have taken @discovery instagram account for prediction of the engagement. One can take any other instagram account for the prediction by using the instaloader module.
The project starts with data collection and pre-processing, followed by feature extraction and selection. The logistic regression model is then trained on the processed data and validated through testing. The project includes a detailed analysis of the model's performance, and a discussion of the results and future work.
